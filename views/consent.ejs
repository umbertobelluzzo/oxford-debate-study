      <h2>Evaluating the Persuasiveness of Large Language Models vs. Skilled Human Debaters in Structured Oxford-Style Debates</h2>

        <p>Before deciding whether to participate, please read this information carefully.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Study Overview</h3>
        <p>This project examines how large language models (LLMs) perform in structured, interactive Oxford-style debate settings compared to skilled human debaters. You will engage in text-based debates against one or more LLMs.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Participation Process</h3>
        <p>You will participate in several short Oxford-style debates (between 5-10 debates), each consisting of three turns on each side: an opening statement, a rebuttal, and a closing statement. Each turn will be limited to approximately 100–150 words. The entire process is expected to take approximately 30-60 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Data Collection and Use</h3>
        <p>We will collect:</p>
        <p>1) Basic demographic information, including age, gender, education level, and experience with debate<br>
           2) Your debate contributions (opening statements, rebuttals, and closing statements)<br>
           3) Your notes and preparation for each debate</p>

        <h3>Anonymity and Confidentiality</h3>
        <p>All your responses will be pseudonymised (e.g., "Debater D-03"). Your debate transcripts will be anonymized before being shown to independent evaluators in Phase 2 of the research.</p>

        <h3>Data Storage and Protection</h3>
        <p>All data will be stored securely on password-protected university servers, pseudonymised through the use of unique participant IDs, and processed in compliance with data protection regulations. Your data may be retained for up to five years, after which it will be deleted.</p>

        <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>Anonymous quotations from your debate transcripts may be used in academic publications, presentations, or open datasets. You will not be identifiable.</p>

        <h3>Right to Withdraw</h3>
        <p>Your participation is voluntary and you are free to withdraw at any time up to two weeks after your final debate, without giving any reason and without any adverse consequences.</p>

        <h3>Compensation</h3>
        <p>There is no monetary payment for participation, but you will receive a certificate of participation and an executive summary of results.</p>
